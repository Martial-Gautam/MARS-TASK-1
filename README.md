# MARS-TASK-1
##TASK 1 FOR RECRUITMENT PROCESS IN MaRS CLUB OF OUR COLLEGE, IIITD&amp;M
- LIGHT DOSE
   - LINUX COMMANDS : We had already learnt basics of Ubuntu Commands in the first year of college. Learnt more of the commands from the attached links in the appendix.
   - SHELL SCRIPTING : This I was doing for the first time. I saw videos still I was not wholly sure to do it, I saw videos, took the help of AI. At last I started                   understanding the this language.
- MEDIUM DOSE
     - QUESTION 1 : As I am already proficient in C, so C++ is obviously a new language but not challenging. I just learnt the syntax of Lambda function from Youtube videos          Geeks for Geeks, I used that concept and syntax in the code.
     - QUESTION 2 : As soon as I saw the question, I searched links, videos about classes and Objects and What makes the C++ better. I learnt the concept of Class like Class is just like a template or say skeleton of object including Variables and expressions, functions etc.
          Functions in Class makes it more good and different than structure. Syntax was almost similar .
- HARD DOSE
     - QUESTION 1 : I have already solved a lot of question regarding prime Numbers. I just saw the question and started doing it and kept on writing.
     - Question 2 : I had no clue about this Question. This was a bouncer type question for me. I searched on GPT about this question, which Language will be the best to solve this question. I got to know Python is best for Image processing as It's an easy OOPS language, I had already explored about Python already.(Python is also new to me - I know only C language) So I searched some solutions regarding this question.
